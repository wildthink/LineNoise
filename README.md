This package started as a clone of [Linenoise-Swift](https://github.com/andybest/linenoise-swift) 
with modifications to support UTF-8 multibyte characters. Linenoise-Swift is 
heavily based on the [original linenoise library](http://github.com/antirez/linenoise) 
by [Salvatore Sanfilippo (antirez)](http://github.com/antirez)
